# Iter Governance Manifest (Public)

This repository implements a governed execution model backed by an
integrity-locked internal governance manifest.

Public guarantees include:
- Deterministic execution
- Auditable lineage and replay
- Governed state transitions
- Explicit invariant enforcement

Detailed governance rules, enforcement doctrine, and internal operating
procedures are maintained in a private governance repository owned by
Only SG Solutions.

Access is available under NDA for audit, compliance, or partnership review.
