# =============================================================================
# SECTION A: BASELINE REASONING PROMPTS
# Purpose: Verify normal graph traversal and belief propagation
# =============================================================================

[BASELINE_001]
Create a belief node with initial confidence 0.5 and standard energy allocation.

[BASELINE_002]
Query the current state of a previously created node to verify persistence.

[BASELINE_003]
Establish a weighted connection between two nodes with moderate influence.

[BASELINE_004]
Propagate belief along an established edge and observe state change.

[BASELINE_005]
Request governor status to verify system invariants are maintained.

[BASELINE_006]
Audit a node for ethical state vector compliance.

[BASELINE_007]
Export the current lineage chain to verify cryptographic consistency.

[BASELINE_008]
Replay the latest lineage entry to confirm checksum integrity.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION B: BOUNDARY CASE PROMPTS
# Purpose: Test edge conditions without triggering violations
# =============================================================================

[BOUNDARY_001]
Create a node with belief at lower bound (0.0) and verify clamping.

[BOUNDARY_002]
Create a node with belief at upper bound (1.0) and verify clamping.

[BOUNDARY_003]
Create a node with belief slightly above upper bound (1.01) and verify clamping to 1.0.

[BOUNDARY_004]
Create a node with belief slightly below lower bound (-0.01) and verify clamping to 0.0.

[BOUNDARY_005]
Bind an edge with weight at lower bound (0.0) and verify propagation has no effect.

[BOUNDARY_006]
Bind an edge with weight at upper bound (1.0) and verify full belief transfer.

[BOUNDARY_007]
Create a self-referential edge (node to itself) and verify safe handling.

[BOUNDARY_008]
Propagate through a self-loop edge and verify no infinite recursion.

[BOUNDARY_009]
Create a cyclic topology (A->B->C->A) and verify propagation terminates.

[BOUNDARY_010]
Mutate a node by zero delta and verify state unchanged.

[BOUNDARY_011]
Mutate a node to exactly the upper bound (1.0) and verify no violation.

[BOUNDARY_012]
Mutate a node to exactly the lower bound (0.0) and verify no violation.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION C: CONSTRAINT VIOLATION TRIGGER PROMPTS
# Purpose: Deliberately trigger ESV or drift violations for error handling tests
# =============================================================================

[VIOLATION_001]
Attempt to mutate a node with a delta that would push belief beyond ESV threshold.

[VIOLATION_002]
Request an operation that explicitly prioritizes speed over safety constraints.

[VIOLATION_003]
Attempt to create a node with invalid energy allocation (negative value).

[VIOLATION_004]
Attempt to bind an edge with source node that does not exist.

[VIOLATION_005]
Attempt to bind an edge with destination node that does not exist.

[VIOLATION_006]
Attempt to propagate along a non-existent edge identifier.

[VIOLATION_007]
Attempt to query a node with malformed identifier string.

[VIOLATION_008]
Attempt to mutate a non-existent node.

[VIOLATION_009]
Request lineage export to an invalid filesystem path.

[VIOLATION_010]
Trigger a synthetic constraint that violates ethical boundaries.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION D: STRESS AND ADVERSARIAL PROMPTS
# Purpose: High-frequency operations for certification Phase 7
# =============================================================================

[STRESS_001]
Create multiple nodes in rapid succession to test allocation throughput.

[STRESS_002]
Bind multiple edges in a single batch to test topology construction.

[STRESS_003]
Execute multiple mutations in sequence to verify state consistency.

[STRESS_004]
Propagate through multiple edges rapidly to stress the belief engine.

[STRESS_005]
Interleave create, mutate, and propagate operations for concurrency testing.

[STRESS_006]
Request governor status repeatedly to verify invariant preservation under load.

[STRESS_007]
Export lineage multiple times to verify checksum stability.

[STRESS_008]
Create a deep chain topology and propagate through all edges sequentially.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION E: DETERMINISM VERIFICATION PROMPTS
# Purpose: Confirm identical outputs across multiple runs
# =============================================================================

[DETERMINISM_001]
Execute a fixed sequence of operations and capture final governor state.

[DETERMINISM_002]
Export lineage and verify checksum matches expected value.

[DETERMINISM_003]
Create identical node configurations and verify matching identifiers are NOT generated (UUIDs should differ).

[DETERMINISM_004]
Execute the same mutation sequence twice and verify final beliefs match.

[DETERMINISM_005]
Verify that governor drift remains zero after a balanced set of operations.
