SCG SUBSTRATE TECHNICAL ATTESTATION
====================================
Package Version: 1.0
Certification Date: 2025-11-26

INVARIANT GUARANTEES
--------------------
Drift Bound:        |Δ coherence| ≤ 1e-10 per graph operation
Energy Conservation: Total graph energy preserved across propagation cycles
Temporal Stability:  Deterministic output independent of system clock
Belief Clamping:     All values constrained to [0.0, 1.0] range

CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROPERTIES
-------------------------
Lineage Integrity:  Merkle-style operation chain with SHA-256 checksums
Reproducibility:    Binary-identical outputs across sequential runs
Error Determinism:  Constraint violations produce fixed error codes
ID Sequencing:      JSON-RPC IDs are sequential integers (1..N)

COMPLIANCE SCOPE
----------------
Domain Neutrality:  Zero business logic; synthetic topology only
Vertical Agnostic:  No healthcare, automotive, financial, or sector-specific primitives
IP Isolation:       No references to customer implementations
Personal Data:      Zero PII, PHI, or identifiable information

VALIDATION METHODOLOGY
----------------------
Dual-Run Test:      Script executes scenario twice; SHA-256 checksums must match
Health Probes:      MCP server startup validated within 5-second timeout
Constraint Testing: Synthetic unsafe operations rejected with code 4000
Normalization:      CRLF→LF, trailing whitespace stripped before hashing

DEMONSTRATION ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------
Protocol:           JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout
Operations Tested:  governor.status, node.create, edge.bind, edge.propagate, lineage.export
Environment:        POSIX-compliant shell (bash 4.0+, jq 1.6+)
Locale:             LC_ALL=C, LANG=C, TZ=UTC

REPRODUCIBILITY CERTIFICATION
------------------------------
Artifact Hash:      588153f3c00a95c3296b576a74f4d8bea8ea556fb2a0366236bd7b21b899d1df
Certification Date: 2025-11-26
Validator:          Dual-run SHA-256 comparison (cryptographic proof)

THREAT MODEL COMPLIANCE
------------------------
Static Analysis:    No exec injection points
Secrets Scanning:   No API keys or credentials (even in comments)
Vertical Fingerprinting: No domain keywords (patient, vehicle, account)
Diff Auditing:      Binary-identical outputs after normalization

NO PRIVATE IP DISCLOSED
All content synthetic and domain-neutral per enterprise review requirements.
