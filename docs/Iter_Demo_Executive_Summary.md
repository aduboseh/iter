# Iter Demo — Executive Summary

## What it is
A demonstration package that exercises Iter’s deterministic tool surface and shows how results can be replayed and independently verified using integrity checks.

## What it demonstrates (high level)
- Deterministic behavior across repeated runs (given identical inputs)
- Governed state transitions and safe failure on invalid operations
- Auditability via integrity summaries suitable for replay/verification
- Domain-neutral, synthetic content intended for external review

## Distribution and validation notes
Detailed certification artifacts, exact parameters, and validation methodology are maintained internally and can be shared with partners under NDA.
